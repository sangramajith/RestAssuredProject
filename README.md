# ApiAutomation

This project is a REST API automation framework using Rest Assured, Cucumber, and Maven.

## Dependencies

- [Rest Assured](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured): A Java library that simplifies writing powerful tests for RESTful APIs by providing a domain-specific language (DSL).
- [Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm): A tool for running automated tests written in plain language. It enables behavior-driven development (BDD) by allowing test scenarios to be written in human-readable format.
- [JUnit](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4): A simple framework for writing repeatable tests in Java. It provides annotations and assertions to facilitate writing and organizing tests.
- [Json Schema Validator](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured): A module of Rest Assured that allows validation of JSON responses against a specified schema.
- [Jackson Databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind): A module of the Jackson JSON processor that provides a way to convert JSON data to and from Java Objects.
- [Maven Cucumber Reporting](https://github.com/damianszczepanik/maven-cucumber-reporting): A Maven plugin that generates HTML reports for Cucumber test results.
